##**Ant colony Optimization algorithm is implemented for below  NP hard problem** ##
1. Traveling salesman Problem
2. Quadratic Assignment Problem
3. Binary Knap-Sack Problem
4. N-Queen Problem

### how to run this to dataset ###
1. put problem dataset file in repective problem folder(for example. for tsp dataset put distance matrix file inside tspdataset folder)
2. File format should be the same as given in example dataset files.
3. Open the file in any python editor and run it.
4. This program will run with ant number of 10,20,30,50 and  if you wnat to change ant size you can change it. There has been check and updation in ant size 
with respect to number of length of list.
